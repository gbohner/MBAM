The $\po$ assay exhibits much worse identifiability than the $\lpo$ assay.  (B). Ellipsoid of constant cost for a toy two-parameter model.  The parameters $\theta_{1,2}$ are constrained in the stiff direction, but have large error regions $\Sigma_{1,2}$ due to the presence of a large sloppy direction.  (C) Calculated $\log(1/{{\rm width}_i}^2$) values for the $\po$ assay (red) and $\lpo$ assay (black).  Both exhibit a linear trend, the signature of a sloppy model.}

\caption{Intermediate MBAM steps, $\po$ assay.  The figure should be read left to right, top to bottom.  The left column displays the parameter values for a given model as MBAM progresses.  The reduced model created upon completion of the parameter search is displayed on the right.  (A). MBAM run for the full, original model.  There are eight lines, corresponding to eight parameters.  One of the parameters goes to zero; this is $z_L,$ and it is eliminated, giving our first reduced model, at right.  (B). In the second iteration, four parameters are observed to diverge: $L_0, \ D, \ E,\ C.$  These parameters are eliminated, and three new, emergent parameters are created ($\phi_{1,2,3}$), yielding a net reduction of one parameter.  (C). Two parameters are observed to diverge: $\phi_2, \ \phi_3$.  Note that there are only six lines, corresponding to the six remaining parameters.  The resulting model (right) has five parameters, and fits the data well (Figure 4).}

This figure shows parameter values during the first parameter reduction, which results in the model with one reduced parameter ($\zl$ eliminated).  Note that as $\zl$ goes to zero, $\lo$ and $\jo$ must decrease, and $D$ must increase, to compensate.  We therefore expect that when the once-reduced model is fit to data generated from the full model, $\lo, \jo$ will be smaller than the true parameters, and $D$ will be larger than the true parameters.  This is what we observe in Figure 8. }

\caption{Figure 8 - supplement figure 2: Inferred parameters from the reduced $\lpo$ model. Values inferred by fitting the once-reduced $\lpo$ model to 100 noisy synthetic measurements generated from base (black) and test (red, blue) parameter sets..  Test parameters are different from those in Figure 8.  Here, the inferred values of our compensatory parameters fall into two modes.  This is because the model is degenerate at the true `best fit' parameter values that the noisy synthetic data were generated from.  Each set of inferred parameters was labeled either red or blue.  The two clouds therefore show that the parameter compensation is consistent for all fits.  Each cloud is discernible from the base parameters, and the mean of the values is discernible from the base parameters.}

The Figures aim to reproduce Milo et al's figure 2a,b (our Figure 8A,B) and Milo et al's figure 4a,b (our Figure 8C,D).  Each point in Figures 8A,C corresponds to human hemoglobin at a different pH.  Each point in Figures 8B,D corresponds to hemoglobin from a different mammal, at the same physiological condition.  We refer the reader to the appropriate figures in Milo et al. for full descriptions of pH conditions and mammals used. }
